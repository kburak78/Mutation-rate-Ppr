This repository encompasses all scripts of how I calculated the mutation rate in Plathynothrus peltifer.

The repository is structured as follows:

0. README-file
1. Sampling and Sequencing
2. Alignment & Post-Alignment Processing
3. Variant Calling with GATK
4. Detect de novo mutations
5. Callable genome estimation 
6. Calculating the mutation rate

You will also find two other files: 
'R Graphs' - the scripts to visualize my results 
'Ppr Eggs' - what I did for the additional data of two eggs
