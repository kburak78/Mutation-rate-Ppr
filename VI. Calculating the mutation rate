## 7. Calculating Mutation rate 

The Mutation rate can be calculated as: 

Mutation counts / (2 x callable sites) = Mutation rate 

With the first calculations something between 1-2x10^-6 comes out which would be higher then for example spider mites. If Ppr has a lower mutation rate we would expect something under around 1*10^-9. 

What did I do differently to Linda? 
What could I have overseen? How many of them could be false-positives?
Is it possible to calculate the mutation rate differently?
